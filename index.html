                                While I don't have an exact timeframe at the moment, please be assured that processing your refund is a top priority for us. As an intermediary of the airline, we are unable to confirm the refund timeframe, as we have to wait for the refund from the airline. 
                                Refunds typically undergo a thorough review process, which can vary based on several factors including payment method, bank processing times, and any specific policies related to your booking. 
                                Rest assured, we are actively working to expedite the process as much as possible. 
                                Our refund team will notify you via email once the refund is processed. 
                                You may also check the refund status on our website under the 'My Bookings' section. 
                                We appreciate your patience and truly value your business.
